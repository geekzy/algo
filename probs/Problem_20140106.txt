Problem 1
You are to calculate the diagonal disproportion of a square matrix. The diagonal disproportion of a square matrix is the sum of the elements of its main diagonal minus the sum of the elements of its collateral diagonal. The main and collateral diagonals of a square matrix are shown in figures 1 and 2 respectively.
 
The elements of the main diagonal are shown in green in figure 1, and the elements of the collateral diagonal are shown in cyan in figure 2.
Given a String[] matrix, return its diagonal disproportion. The j'th character of the i'th element ofmatrix should be treated as the element in the i'th row and j'th column of the matrix.
     
Class: DiagonalDisproportion
Method: getDisproportion
Parameters: String[]
Returns: int
Method signature: int getDisproportion(String[] matrix)
(be sure your method is public)
 
Constraints:
- matrix will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
- each element of matrix will contain only digits ('0'-'9').
- the number of characters in each element of matrix will be equal to the number of elements in matrix.
 
Examples
0)
{"190","828","373"}

Returns: 1
The sum of the elements of the main diagonal is 1+2+3 = 6. The sum of the elements of the collateral diagonal is 0+2+3 = 5. So, the answer is 6-5 = 1.

1)
{"9000","0120","0000","9000"}

Returns: -1

2)
{"6"}

Returns: 0
The matrix has only one element, and this element lies on both the main and collateral diagonals.

3)
{"7748297018","8395414567","7006199788","5446757413","2972498628",
"0508396790","9986085827","2386063041","5687189519","7729785238"}

Returns: -24

Problem 2
Fox Ciel is playing the popular game 'Cut the Rope' on her smartphone. The game has multiple stages, and for each stage the player can gain between 0 and 3 stars, inclusive. You are given a String[]result containing Fox Ciel's current results: For each stage, result contains an element that specifies Ciel's result in that stage. More precisely, result[i] will be "---" if she got 0 stars in stage i, "o--" if she got 1 star, "oo-" if she got 2 stars and "ooo" if she managed to get all 3 stars. Return the total number of stars Ciel has at the moment.
    
Class: FoxAndGame
Method: countStars
Parameters: String[]
Returns: int
Method signature: int countStars(String[] result)
(be sure your method is public)

Constraints:
- result will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
- each element in result will be one of "---", "o--", "oo-", "ooo".
 
Examples
0)
{"ooo",
 "ooo"}

Returns: 6
There are two stages. In each of them, Ciel got all three stars. Together, she now has 3+3 = 6 stars.

1)
{"ooo",
 "oo-",
 "o--"}

Returns: 6
This time the answer is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6.

2)
{"ooo",
 "---",
 "oo-",
 "---",
 "o--"}

Returns: 6

3)
{"o--",
 "o--",
 "o--",
 "ooo",
 "---"}

Returns: 6

4)
{"---",
 "o--",
 "oo-",
 "ooo",
 "ooo",
 "oo-",
 "o--",
 "---"}

Returns: 12

5)
{"---",
 "---",
 "---",
 "---",
 "---",

Returns: 0

6)
{"oo-"}

Returns: 2
